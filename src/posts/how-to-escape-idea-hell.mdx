A lot of times I've caught myself thinking about project ideas, all kinds of
them. I've thought about ideas that could save me a few seconds every day and
ideas that could turn me into a millionaire.

The common point between them is the fact that I did neither.

How do I save myself from this hell? This idea hell? If you were expecting
an answer, I'm sorry to let you know that I don't know.

The thing is, it's never enough for me. I always find something wrong with them
before I even start getting it out of the paper.

I'm my own villain.

A few months ago, a friend who is also a programmer told me to my face that I
should just do it. In the most [Shia
Labeouf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0) / Nike way. But it was not
enough. Is there something wrong with me?

I've thought about moving to SF a few times already. I've always thought I'd
benefit from the culture and actually get something out of it. I guess I could try.

My point is, I'm human, and humans suffer from thinking too much. Thinking is
fast and more rewarding.

Your brain will always prefer novelty over execution,
because coming up with ideas gives you a dopamine hit, but executing them is
harder and less rewarding at first. So the brain resists the effort required to
turn an idea into something concrete.

Anyway, I decided to spend some minutes writing about this because my New Year's
resolution for 2026 is to actually build something. I'm stronger than my human brain.
If people can do it, so can I.

For you struggling like me, please, just do it.
