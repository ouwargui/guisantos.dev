If you've developed React Native applications before, you certainly used the
<Code inline>{'<Button />'}</Code> component at some point and realized how
limited it is, since the <Code inline>{'<Button />'}</Code> component uses the
native style and doesn't allow for much customization.

You might have turned to the <Code inline>{'<TouchableOpacity />'}</Code> or
<Code inline>{'<TouchableHighlight />'}</Code> components to create buttons
that look more like the ones you see in different apps. These components are
more flexible and allow you to customize the look and feel of your buttons
to match your app's design, they also provide a better user experience by
giving users a visual feedback when they press the button.

But then when React Native v0.63 was released, the <Code inline>{'<Pressable />'}</Code>
component was introduced, and it's the recommended way to handle user interactions
within your app. Although it improved the API for handling touch events, **it
doesn't provide all the built-in styles and effects that the Touchables do**.

You can read more about why the <Code inline>{'<Pressable />'}</Code> component was introduced
on the [React Native v0.63 announcement blog post](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2020/07/06/version-0.63#pressable).

## Setup project

I'll be using [**Expo**](https://expo.dev) and
[**React Native Reanimated**](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
to create the examples in this post, but you can translate the code to use the React
Native Animated API if you prefer.

To set up this project, I ran the following command:

<Code language="bash">
{[
  'bun create expo pressables --template blank-typescript',
  'cd pressables',
  'bun expo install react-native-reanimated',
  '',
  'bun ios'
].join('\n')}
</Code>

## Pressable with opacity

Let's start by creating the same visual feedback that the <Code inline>{'<TouchableOpacity />'}</Code>
component provides, which is the opacity effect when the user presses the button.

<Code language="tsx" fileName="app.tsx">
  {`import {
    Pressable,
    StyleSheet,
    Text,
    TouchableOpacity,
    View,
  } from "react-native";
  import Animated, {
    useAnimatedStyle,
    useSharedValue,
    withTiming,
  } from "react-native-reanimated";

  const AnimatedPressable = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Pressable);

  export default function App() {
    const pressed = useSharedValue(false);

    const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => {
      const opacity = pressed.value
        ? 0.2
        : withTiming(1, {
            duration: 200,
          });

      return {
        opacity: opacity,
        backgroundColor: "purple",
        padding: 20,
        borderRadius: 5,
        width: 150,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
      };
    });

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <TouchableOpacity
          style={{
            backgroundColor: "purple",
            padding: 20,
            borderRadius: 5,
            width: 150,
            justifyContent: "center",
            alignItems: "center",
          }}
        >
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Touchable</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
        <AnimatedPressable
          style={animatedStyle}
          onPressIn={() => {
            pressed.value = true;
          }}
          onPressOut={() => {
            pressed.value = false;
          }}
        >
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Pressable</Text>
        </AnimatedPressable>
      </View>
    );
  }

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      backgroundColor: "#fff",
      alignItems: "center",
      gap: 10,
      justifyContent: "center",
    },
    buttonText: {
      fontSize: 20,
    },
  });`}
</Code>

## Pressable with scale

This is one of my favorites
