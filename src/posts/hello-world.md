# Hello World 🙋🏻‍♂️

Welcome to my blog and **my first post**. In this blog I will share my experiences and knowledge about software development and other things that I like. On this first post I will talk about why I decided to create this blog and what you can expect from it.

## Who am I? 👨🏻‍💻

My name is **Guilherme**, I'm 21 years old and I'm a Software Engineer at **IBM**. I'm from Brazil and I'm currently living in São Paulo. I'm passionate about technology and I love to learn new things. I'm also a huge fan of sports and I love the american leagues like the NFL and the NBA.
    
I've worked with projects using **React Native**, **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**, **Node.js**, **Java**, **Python** and the list goes on. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills.

## Why did I create this blog? 🤔

I've been thinking about creating a blog for a long time, but I never had the courage to do it. I was always afraid of not being able to keep it updated and end up abandoning it. But I decided to take the risk and create it anyway. I think it will be a great way to share my experiences and knowledge with other people and also a way to improve my writing skills.
    
I also wanted to test the new **Next.js** app router with **RSC** (React server components), which is part of the stack that I'm using to build this website. I will talk more about it in a future post with a full tutorial on how to create a blog just like this one.
    
Besides that, it will be a great way to keep track of my progress and my learning journey. I will try to post at least once a week, but I can't promise anything. I will try my best to keep it updated.

## What can you expect from this blog? 🤓

I will try to post about things that I'm learning and things that I'm passionate about. I will also post about my experiences and things that I've learned or am learning throughout my career.
    
If you have any suggestions or want to talk about something, feel free to reach me on my [Email](mailto:me@guisantos.dev) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guiksantos/). I will be happy to talk to you.

## Conclusion 📝

I hope you enjoyed this first post and I hope to see you again on the next one. Thanks for reading and have a nice day! 🤗
